<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
  when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an
  adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo
  to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
  force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      n the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the
      mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other
      Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in
      TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This
      was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA
      2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
      Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken
      tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.[2]

    <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their
      mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and
      great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long
      nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941
      joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
      would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his
      brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the
      Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and
      later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The
      Company of Thorin.

    <h3>Glóin</h3>
    <p>
      Glóin was born in TA 2783, after Erebor, after the Dragon Smaug desolated
      Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar,
      the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown
      what significance he did, being 16 years old.

      Dwalin was one of the Dwarves who traveled with Bilbo and Gandalf as a
      member of Thorin and Company on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain
      from the Dragon Smaug. He was the brother of Balin and the youngest son of

    <h3>Ori</h3>
    <p>
      Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years.
      In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled
      with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest
      for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he
      and the other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five
      Armies, which he survived.[

    <h3>Dori</h3>
    <p>
      Dori fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies. He likely returned
      to the Lonely Mountain, where he survived up until the time of the Council
      of Elrond and the War of the Ring, most likely fighting in the Battle of
      Dale, though his exact death date is unknown.

    <h3>Nori</h3>
    <p>
      Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to
      have carried their flutes with them. Both shared Bilbo's liking for
      regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in
      Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

    <h3>Bifur</h3>
    <p>
      Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of
      Durin's Folk. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is
      known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out
      of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced
      to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following
      Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued
      his life as a toy maker.

    <h3>Bofur</h3>
    <p>
      Bofur's heritage is unclear, but he was not of Durin's Folk. He and his
      family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly
      about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more
      interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

    <h3>Bombur</h3>
    <p>
      Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of
      Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the
      Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere
      between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest
      of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured,
      Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born
      in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior
      to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside
      Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

    <h3>Gandalf</h3>
    <p>
      Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar
      (with the possible exception of Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before
      the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the
      Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth," he became one of the Maiar
      who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo and Nienna named. He was associated with
      light and fire, much like his peer Varda. Yet his ways often took him
      to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but
      he walked unseen among them, or wore a fana that appeared like an Elf, and
      sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout
      his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, he took pity on the
      sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drove those who listened to him
      out of despair.
